# Hosting
The recommended way to host the GeneralServer and the WebClient is to use one device. Since both the GeneralServer and the WebClient are designed to be lightweight,
a good device to host them both would be a Raspberry Pi with 4GB+ of memory. 

## Kill three birds with one stone
In my personal setup, I use one Raspberry Pi to host the GeneralServer and WebClient. After hosting those two, I noticed that the Pi could handle more
in terms of computation. I decided to use the Pi as a in-home access point so the members of my home could control the devices without having to go through the
hassle of connecting on their own devices. They could just go into a hallway and control something at will(if they have the passwords). This also reduces the
amount of users that will be connected to the server at one point, freeing up even more computational power on the Pi.
